toobox_signal - image processing related functions.

This toolbox contains functions related to image processing, including 
* images loading and generation.
* filtering and blurring functions.
* anisotropic and spacially variant filters.
* non-linear filtering (median, LIC, bilateral).
* High Dynamic Range image loading and equalization.
* total variation image processing (denoising and decomposition).
* non-wavelets image transforms such as local DCT.
* Various helpers functions.
